## About me

### 💻 Technically speaking ⚙️...
Hello! I'm Abhilash. I'm a **Java and NodeJS Full-Stack Engineer**. I regard myself as a **student for lifetime**. I love to make **web more engaging**. I'm a curious person and love to learn new technologies. **I'm a Machine Learning (ML) enthusiast, currently pursuing UnderGrad in ML & DS @ IIT Madras**.

### ❤️ My Interests ❤️
I'm cool and calm person, like to hangout with friends. I like people with good sense of humour. So, obviously, humour is one of my genres. I regard health and family are more important in life.

I watch cartoons, Doraemon and Kick Butowsky are my all time favourites.
